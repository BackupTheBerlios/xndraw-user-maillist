Subject: [Xndraw-user] xndraw initial source code release
Message-ID: <CAJ_eeFUpuT+JJ4ytkRqGJKctCnFfpqZ+aZfYgscVngpTc7rg2g@mail.gmail.com>

The xndraw team would like to announce the first source release of xndraw, a
program to create tilable shapes, wallpapers, and other patterns.

xndraw should compile on unix like OS such as linux, BSD. Depends on gtkmm,
and cairomm (with svg), and python.

Feedback and potential collaborators/contributors will be welcomed
